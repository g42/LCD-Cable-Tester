## Turn on

There is a 3-position switch to control the tester's power supply. In automatic mode, the tester turns on automatically when the cable is connected to any of the connectors. To turn on the tester, one of the standard GND wires is used. 

If there is a non-standard or damaged cable, the function may not work. In this case, you can force the tester to turn on using the switch. 

However, in some cases, it may be useful to force the tester to shut down. For example, to check the lines manually with a multimeter using test pads on the tester. Switch to the OFF position in that case.

## Battery
The device is powered by a Li-Ion battery. Solder pads are on the back of the PCB. Recommend capacity 100 - 1000 mAh. The default charging current is 100 mA. Can be increased up to 500 mA by changing the resistor R5.
